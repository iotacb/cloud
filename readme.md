## What is Cloud?

Cloud is a 2D game engine for Java. It's using [LWJGL]() under to hood. Currently it's still in an early phase and should only be used for small projects.

## What's possible?

[Here]() you can find some demo projects.

The main focus of Cloud is to make it easier to work with LWJGL.

It's mainly a wrapper for the basic functionality of LWJGL.
Which means, if a feature is missing you can easily add it to the engine either by forking the repository or directly in your project.

## What's included

Cloud already ships with a lot of functionality like a pyhsics engine based on [Box2D]() or a ui system.

## What's missing?

Currently Cloud doesn't support batch rendering, this will be added in a later version.
